Damage type colours:

- **White —** Base Damage
    - This is the most common damage type. If your attack was not a critical strike or did not trigger Overpower, it will be this color.
- **Yellow** — Critical Damage
    - Based on your Critical Strike Chance stat, you have a randomized chance to critically strike with each attack. If you do, it will look like this.
- **Aqua Blue —** Overpower Damage
    - When you trigger Overpower, this is the color of the damage. Once again, the base chance for this is 3%, but you can guarantee it via certain effects.
- **Orange** — Critical Overpower Damage
    - This rare damage occurs when you trigger Overpower *and* critically strike based on your Critical Strike Chance stat. This is the highest amount of damage you can deal with an attack.
